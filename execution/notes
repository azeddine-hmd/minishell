This file will be dedicated to personal notes e.g: where I left and other major stuff. This file is to be checked everytime I take a long pause from school and forgot where did I reached in my project.

<==========================================================================================================>

-> Currently working on:
	- splitting the builtins into different files to make it easier to read my code after a long break now. ✓✓✓
	- heredoc redirection.
	-
-> Latest thing I've been working on before push:
	- Finished splitting the bultins ( to check ) probably seperate the red/pipe now.
	- 

-> Thinks to watch out for (When on Linux):
	- [libft/Makefile]: Deleted -I from the headerfile + added the move line.
	- [Makefile]: Added a file [echo.c].

->> PS: - It's annoying to not focus on one specific task, instead of hesistating between exit status or heredoc implementation just choose one
